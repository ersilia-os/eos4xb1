Title: Antihypertension prediction
Description: This model is built on a manually curated collection of natural products
  and synthetic derivatives with antihypertension activity, as well as target-specific data. The actives have been
  curated by the CeDD (University of Buea) and the negatives are added from the decoy
  sampler eos3e6s. Models are built with LazyQSAR.
