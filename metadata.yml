Title: Antihypertension prediction
Description: This model is built on a manually curated collection of natural 
  products and synthetic derivatives with antihypertension activity, as well as 
  target-specific data. The actives have been curated by the CeDD (University of
  Buea) and the negatives are added from the decoy sampler eos3e6s. Models are 
  built with LazyQSAR.
