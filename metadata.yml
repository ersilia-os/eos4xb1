Title: Antihypertension prediction
Description: This model is built on a manually curated collection of natural products
  and synthetic derivatives with antihypertension activity. The actives have been
  curated by the CeDD (University of Buea) and the negatives are added from the decoy
  sampler eos3e6s. Models are built with LazyQSAR.
